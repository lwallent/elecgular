## Ideas for the Icons Module

### Workbench module
 * Show path in footer thingy?
 * Add Sub sections to Icons on sidebar a la MS DevOps? 
 * Make menu Items contributed from the modules.
 * Make settingstab a contribution point?
 * Make shortcuts contributions?
 * Make theming a settings tab
 * Make title just work from RouteNavigationEnd?
 * Change Icon routes to use child routes.

### Modules

 * User (Authentication, Role administration, user settings, )
 * Scheduling (Setup available slots, pick available time, Appointments, show calendar)
 * Survey? (Create questionaires, Render them)
 * Reporting (create and show reports?)

### Widgets
